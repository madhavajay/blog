<p><small style="color: gray; font-size: 0.85em;">üëã Hi to all the HN traffic! Discussion <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43761835#43763630" target="_blank">here</a>.</small></p>
<p>I have to say this is one of the best books I have ever read. Author <a href="https://x.com/andrewchen" target="_blank">@andrewchen (Andrew Chen)</a> from a16z goes into depth from personal experience and research on what it takes to build a networked product and platform and more importantly what critical mistakes that people make and how to recover from them with actionable strategies and tactics.</p>
<p>The book is long but worth it, but since I know you are busy (hopefully trying to build a network), let me give you the tasty bits.</p>
<h3 id="it-s-a-paradox">It's a Paradox</h3>
<p>Andrew writes an amazing insight at the end of the book that sums up the whole shebang:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>But here‚Äôs the paradox: To build a massive successful network effect, I argue that you must start with a smaller, atomic network. And use the success in the first set of networks to tip over the next set of small networks.
</span><span>
</span><span>I‚Äôm not convinced this step can be avoided.
</span></code></pre>
<p>Pay attention to that last bit. üëÜ Chen has spent a lot of time thinking about this and concludes there is no one-shot way to skip the "a big network" is built from "the smallest possible network".</p>
<h3 id="define-atomic-network"><strong>Define:</strong> Atomic Network</h3>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>The smallest possible network of users that can stand on its own and provide value to its members, thereby becoming stable and self-sustaining.
</span></code></pre>
<p>So to Chen's suggestion, we must focus on the MVN (Minimum Viable Network) the smallest number of users for which they will continue to generate actions in the system.</p>
<p>Each action that one user does generates actions from the others and they inturn continue like a perpetual motion machine. They do this because the network gives them value for participating and participating generates value for the others.</p>
<h3 id="define-hard-side"><strong>Define:</strong> Hard Side</h3>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>The group of users who create disproportionate value for the network, often by providing the core content, service, product listings, or liquidity that attracts the &quot;easy side&quot; (e.g., consumers, viewers, buyers).
</span></code></pre>
<p>Key characteristics often include:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are essential for the network's core value proposition to function.</li>
<li>They are typically smaller in number compared to the easy side.</li>
<li>They are usually harder, more complex, or more expensive to acquire and retain.</li>
<li>Solving their specific problems or pain points is often the key to overcoming the Cold Start Problem.</li>
<li>Examples from the book include Uber drivers, Airbnb hosts, YouTube creators, and eBay sellers. Successfully attracting and retaining the hard side is crucial for bootstrapping and scaling a network effect business.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-who-s-who">The Who's Who</h2>
<p>Okay let's take a look at a list of the players mentioned in the book, how they started, what their hard side customer was, the approximate size of their atomic networks; and the one or more strategies they employed to beat the Cold Start problem and achieve network effects.</p>

<h2 id="cold-to-warm">Cold to Warm</h2>
<p>We can split these strategies into two phases. The 0 - 1 Cold Start where there are no atomic networks or users or they are very small, and 1 - N (Warm) where companies fought to grow beyond their initial niches and take on competition to win network effects.</p>
<h3 id="0-1-cold">0 - 1 Cold</h3>
<p>At a glance this tells us that most of these networks leveraged a few key strategies in their earliest phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Solving a Hard Problem</li>
<li>Come for the Tool</li>
<li>Atomic Network</li>
<li>Killer Product</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these could be argued to share similar meanings, for example, a useful tool for one can be the killer product itself, a killer product might solve a hard problem (but it doesn't have to) however behind all of them is value being generated for a primary user, and then as an extension atomic networks forming as that value draws in secondary users.</p>
<p>While the book doesn't mention it, I would argue that many of these had magic moments built into them as well like the first time you get an Uber and watch the car on the screen as it gets closer to you.</p>

<p>Interestingly, as these network effects begin to take hold, the ways to grow, prevent anti-network effects, and defend against competition seem to vary greatly by the specific product or company. I think the lesson here is best summed up by <a href="https://x.com/reidhoffman" target="_blank">@reidhoffman (Reid Hoffman)</a> in the book <a href="https://amzn.to/3EK1Fal" target="_blank">Blitzscaling</a>:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>&quot;The strategy that gets you to your first hundred users is not the strategy that gets you to your first thousand‚Äîor your first million.&quot;

    <tr>
      <td>Launching Too Broadly / Targeting Large TAM from Day 1</td>
      <td>Counterintuitively, building a massive network requires starting with the smallest possible, viable, dense Atomic Network. Dominate a niche first. This initial focus might seem like a "toy" market (e.g., Airbnb's air mattresses, eBay's Beanie Babies, Tinder's frat parties, Instagram's filters), but this hyper-focus is essential to build the critical first stable network before expanding. (Ref: Chapters 4, 6)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ignoring Network Density (Focusing on total users over connections / interactions)</td>
      <td>Prioritize achieving high density within the Atomic Network. Ensure sufficient interaction/value exchange between initial users before scaling. (Ref: Chapters 4, 6, 11)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Focusing Only on the "Easy Side" (e.g., attracting buyers before sellers)</td>
      <td>Identify and prioritize solving the problem for and acquiring the "Hard Side" first, as they often create the value that attracts the easy side. (Ref: Chapter 7)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Relying too much on Hard Side users (like creators or sellers) to join, causing the network to fail before it gains value.</td>
      <td>Use "Flintstoning" ‚Äì manually create or fake the hard side's contributions initially. Create the first posts, listings, or content yourself to make the network look active and valuable (like the Reddit founders did). This can attract the "easy side" and eventually draw in the real "hard side" once there's an audience. Don't be afraid to "fake it 'til you make it" to overcome the initial emptiness. (Ref: Chapter 15)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Confusing Virality with Network Effects</td>
      <td>Understand the core definition: network effects mean the product inherently becomes more valuable with more users. Focus on building this value, not just on tactics for rapid viral spread. (Ref: Chapter 1)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Neglecting the Early User Experience / Lack of "Magic Moments"</td>
      <td>Intentionally design onboarding and early interactions to quickly deliver the core network value proposition (the "Magic Moment") to hook new users. For Clubhouse during its peak hype, the "Magic Moment" was often described as the experience of a new user opening the app and almost immediately dropping into a live, engaging, and perhaps even serendipitous audio conversation featuring interesting people discussing relevant topics. (Ref: Chapter 10).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Attempting a "Big Bang" Launch for a New Network</td>
      <td>Build atomic networks organically first; solve the Cold Start Problem through focused effort before attempting large-scale rollouts. Avoid the "Big Bang Failure" pattern like Google+. (Ref: Chapter 32)</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Not Anticipating or Managing Anti-Network Effects Early</td>
      <td>Proactively design mechanisms for Curation, Moderation, and Quality Control from the start to mitigate potential issues like spam, fraud, and noise. When new users encounter these problems, they are likely to have a negative first impression, fail to see the platform's value, and ultimately leave (churn). You cannot achieve viral growth (like a K-factor > 0.7) if new users don't stay long enough to use it. (Ref: Chapter 5, 27)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Over-relying on Unsustainable Subsidies/Incentives</td>
      <td>Use Paying Up / Subsidies strategically and temporarily, primarily to bootstrap the hard side or overcome initial friction. Focus on building inherent, long-term network value. You should generally avoid deploying significant spending on subsidies until you have validated that the core product provides enough fundamental value to retain users. (Ref: Chapter 14).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Believing the Software Alone Creates the Network</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Not Defining the Core Interaction or Value Unit</td>

      <td>Giving Up Before Reaching the Tipping Point</td>
      <td>Understand that the Cold Start phase is inherently difficult and slow. Persist with focused Hustle and iterative strategies to build the Atomic Network until it can grow organically. (Ref: Chapter 16)</td>

<h3 id="things-to-consider">Things to Consider</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To be able to infer what the root cause might be you should be looking at data where possible, of who is hitting your pages, what they do when they are there and how long they stay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider what the lowest friction actions are that users can do to generate value for another user. For example in youtube that was likes and comments and make sure that this back and forth activity is optimized for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will want to try to classify behavior / actions that you believe produce value for your network and try to see why they aren't materializing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where ever possible, watch or survey your real users to understand what their friction points are and if they are encountering any anti-network effects. Every user you convert into an action producing member brings your k-factor up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have a good idea on the atomic network size needed ensure you are trying to seed that network by bringing together those users even if you have to hustle or flintstone their counter parts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure the experience is magical, if there's no wow factor, either you failed to show why its interesting or its just not interesting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be careful to curate an experience that appears more full than it is by refining how the listings and interactions are displayed. You may need to down scope and only invite individuals that match that scope.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="solving-a-hard-problem">Solving a Hard Problem</h3>
<p>Perhaps you have not really solved a hard problem yet, as <a href="https://x.com/paulg/status/1912509780976951554" target="_blank">@paulg (Paul Graham)</a> says:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>A startup&#39;s initial problem is usually what the product should be and how to get the first users. It may sound like those are two problems, but they&#39;re not. Ideally you solve them simultaneously, and the process of trying to get users shows you what the product should be.
</span></code></pre>
<h3 id="single-player">Single Player</h3>
<p>As per the above, if you make something useful for one person (or entity) then you can continue to follow the <code>gradient of value</code> to discover what they need and how they can start to interact as a network.</p>
<p>As co-founder of Youtube <a href="https://x.com/StartupArchive_/status/1912898880536039644" target="_blank">Chad Hurley said</a>:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>&quot;The idea is to initially attract users with a single-player tool and then, over time, get them to participate in a network. The tool helps get to initial critical mass. The network creates the long term value for users, and defensibility for the company... starting a network from scratch is very hard. Think of single-player tools as kindling.&quot;
</span></code></pre>
<h3 id="gradient-of-user-value">Gradient of User Value</h3>
<p>This dove-tails nicely into a tweet from the legendary
<a href="https://x.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1910351545658466794" target="_blank">@ID_AA_Carmack (John Carmack)</a></p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>Feedback beats planning.
</span><span>
</span><span>My plea at Meta was &quot;No grand plans, follow the gradient of user value&quot;.
</span></code></pre>
<p>To which <a href="https://x.com/jimkxa/status/1910365848663146576" target="_blank">@jimkxa (Jim Keller) piled-on</a>:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>&quot;Follow the gradient&quot;  That&#39;s great. 
</span><span>
</span><span>We are learning so much from open source, shipping, screwing up and figuring it out. 
</span><span>
</span><span>Plans are good, reality is better
</span></code></pre>
<h3 id="cherry-picking">Cherry Picking</h3>
<p>Finally, if you are having trouble getting that initial thread of user gradient to follow you might need to look at what the competition is doing.</p>
<p>Since users have limited eye-ball time, consider if your initial users might be poorly served elsewhere and try the Cherry Picking (with some Flintstoning) strategy to serve their needs better and try to switch them over.</p>
<p>The book talks about how Craigslist was an initial online directory and collection of mini communities which was unable to defend against Cherry Picking resulting in the following companies which unbundled their customers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Indeed: Targeted the Jobs section.</li>
  <li>StubHub: Targeted the Tickets section.</li>
  <li>Etsy: Targeted the Arts and Crafts for sale section.</li>
  <li>Airbnb: Targeted the Room Rentals/Short-term Stays category.</li>
  <li>Tinder: Targeted the Personals/Dating category.</li>
  <li>Zillow/Trulia: Targeted the Housing/Real Estate listings.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="stage-1-n-warm">Stage 1 - N (Warm)</h2>
<p>I imagine after you have this initial user value gradient, one or more self sustaining (for now) atomic networks, and potentially even some reasonable &lt;1.0 k-factor growth you could consider yourself no longer requiring a "Cold Start" and should focus your attention on the parts of the book relating to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Tipping Point (Part III, Chapters 11-16): This is the immediate next phase. Focus here is on scaling beyond the first atomic network(s) by finding repeatable growth strategies (like Invite-Only, Come for the Tool, Paying Up, Flintstoning, or Hustle) to capture adjacent networks and accelerate growth across the broader market. ¬†</li>
<li>Escape Velocity (Part IV, Chapters 17-21): Aiming for rapid, self-sustaining growth. This involves understanding and optimizing the Trio of Forces:
<ul>
<li>The Acquisition Effect (viral growth). ¬†</li>
<li>The Engagement Effect (making the network stickier). ¬†</li>
<li>The Economic Effect (improving monetization and business model). ¬†
¬†</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(Anticipating) Hitting the Ceiling (Part V, Chapters 22-28): While not the immediate focus, understanding the factors that eventually slow growth (saturation, degrading channels, network revolts, etc.) helps in making strategic decisions during the Escape Velocity phase to mitigate future slowdowns.</li>
</ul>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>To build something massive, you must start small. Nail the atomic network, follow the user value gradient, and let each success tip over the next. Plans are fine‚Äîreality wins. Listen. Hustle.  Stack momentum.
</span></code></pre>
<p>Regardless of if you are at the cold or warm stage of building a Network, I would urge you to read this excellent the book yourself.</p>
<p>Good luck out there! <strong>Don't stay ü•∂ FROSTY</strong>.</p>

  <li id="economic-effect"><strong>Economic Effect:</strong><br />One of the three core forces driving Escape Velocity; occurs when the scaled network enables stronger monetization, better unit economics (LTV/CAC), and reinvestment into further growth.</li>
  <li id="engagement-effect"><strong>Engagement Effect:</strong><br />One of the three core forces driving Escape Velocity; occurs when the growing network becomes stickier, increasing user retention and activity due to more content, connections, and value.</li>
  <li id="eternal-september"><strong>Eternal September:</strong><br />A phenomenon where a rapid influx of new, often less-informed users can degrade the quality and culture of an established online community if not managed well through onboarding and moderation.</li>
  <li id="flintstoning"><strong>Flintstoning:</strong><br />Manually simulating network activity or value in the very early stages ("faking it 'til you make it") to make the product seem active and valuable to attract initial organic users (e.g., Reddit founders posting initial content).</li>
