ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Madhava â€” a Llamavore, Stacknostic Open Sourcerer, Digital Homad; Taker of Photos; Dog's best friend and newly minted dad.
I've got 20+ years of experience building things. I'm currently Head of Engineering at OpenMined, where I work on [SyftBox](https://syftbox.net/).

I've worked across continents, stacks, and sectors â€” from websites and ecommerce to award winning iOS apps, devops and then early stage AI startups. Along the way, I've written code in PHP, SQL, HTML / JavaScript, Java / Kotlin, Swift / Objective-C, Rust and lately mostly Python.

Right now im living in Brisbane, Australia and enjoying what the generative AI renaissance brings!
