      <h3>The Future</h3>
</div>
<br />

-------------------------------------

<h2 id="the-big-shift">The Big Shift</h2>
<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/the-big-shift.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="the-big-shift">

<h3 id="i-was-wrong-about-claude-code">I was wrong about Claude Code</h3>

Like many others, I tried `claude code` months ago when it came out, put in my anthropic `api key` and watched it spin its wheels üõû so hard it burnt around `15 dollars` worth of API tokens and turned my git repo into an AI slop mud pit. 

My immediate thought was, nice try üòú but no thanks, back to Cursor.

But I was wrong.

<h3 id="what-changed-the-tectonic-shift">What Changed? The Trifecta:</h3>

<br />
<h3>1) AYCE (all you can eat) API Token plans (Claude Max)</h3>

<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/claude-max.jpg" style="width: 50%; float: right;" alt="claude-max">
While not strictly unlimited, it has a hard cap. The reality is without hardcaps the human mind always reverts to a scarcity mentality. Without fear of scarey bills the community has moved like lightning to suddenly adopt these tools.


<div style="clear: both; margin-bottom: 10px;"></div>

<h3>2) Claude 4 (and other models) have crossed a threshold</h3>

Yes, this applies to Gemini 2.5 Pro and a few others too, the recent CoT (chain of thought) + subagent planning abilities of frontier models get things right `so often now`, you no longer doubt they can do something in `1-shot` (first try).

For instance, the excellent <a href="https://x.com/GeoffreyHuntley/" target="_blank">@GeoffreyHuntley</a> has been vibe tweeting non-stop about his army of agents writing a new programming language called <a href="https://github.com/ghuntley/cursed">`cursed`</a>:  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">500 AI subagents making a compiler afk whilst i fly internationally to sfo <a href="https://t.co/wxkhP5nUjF">https://t.co/wxkhP5nUjF</a></p>&mdash; geoff (@GeoffreyHuntley) <a href="https://twitter.com/GeoffreyHuntley/status/1933660332670828544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 13, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The thing is this ‚òùÔ∏è level of insanity is only really possible when you have all you can eat tokens, unless you're a fan of bankruptcy level AWS bills.

<h3>3) Optimal Workflow tools like Claude Code and Vibe Tunnel</h3>

Cursor is great (they just added a mobile mode), but its an IDE for humans. When you finally `grok` using something like Claude Code you realise all the advantages of an `agent-first` UI. By forcing you off the tools, you learn to rise up the stack and `multi-plex` your efforts across agents and projects. 

Plus, by being text only, it lets you `multi-plex` across time and space too. 

As <a href="https://x.com/@steipete">Peter (@steipete)</a> says in his recent interview with the awesome <a href="https://x.com/waghnakh_21">Mayank Gupta (@waghnakh_21)</a> (below), Cursors system prompt is optimzied for the user to pick context.

Claude on the otherhand is excellent at finding and using the right context itself and is context / token hungry (why you need AYCE tokens).

Also something that has come up in a convesation with <a href="https://x.com/@mitsuhiko">Armin Ronacher (@mitsuhiko)</a> is theres a certain `je ne sais quoi` ineffable quality to running a local agent on your machine which beats the cloud agents.

When you use `claude code` locally, I would describe it as `feeling` as though you are "In the room" when the code was made. You were there through success and failure collaborating with the agent and so you feel attached emotionally to the artifacts it produces.

That is distinctly different to having some Cloud AI agent like `devin` or `jules` just open a PR on its own.

When that happens 100% automatically, and its `too magical`, it crosses the uncanny valley into weird killer robot mode and triggers your NIH (not invented here) senses really hard.


Likewise, for <a href="https://x.com/@steipete">Peter Steinberger (@steipete)</a> and many others you just can't get the same MacOS versions or access to real hardware to do real Apple development. I imagine the same applies to things like Windows or any kind of complex IoT / custom hardware, nested virtualization etc. 

Real work is done via the Personal Laptop / Desktop with a human-in-the-loop and that isn't likely to change any time soon.

Claude Code is so good, that it's no surprise for me to wake up mid-writing this blog post and read as reported by <a href="https://x.com/swyx">@swyz</a> that the lead developers of Claude Code just got poached (META barbarians at the gate style) by <a href="https://x.com/cursor_ai">@cursor_ai</a>: <br />
<a href="https://x.com/swyx/status/1940124280249020567"><img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/cursor-claude.jpeg" style="width: 100%;" alt="cursor-claude-image"></a>


<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/my-vibes.jpg" style="width: 50%; float: right; margin-left:10px;" alt="my-vibes"> It is these three things which have now kick started a crazy movement. 

As we speak, myself and others are literally `vibe coding` 4 projects at once, at 20x effectiveness from bed, or the supermarket; or the pool!

### How?

With <a href="https://vibetunnel.sh/" target="_blank">VibeTunnel.sh</a> you can now have 24/7 access to `claude code` on your desktop computer from your phone. Thats `your IP`, your `login credentials`, `your VPNs`, `your code repos`, MCP servers; everything to be `maximally` productive. This is an important difference with online only tools like <a href="https://devin.ai/" target="_blank">devin</a> or <a href="https://jules.google/" target="_blank">jules</a>.

VibeTunnnel was created by <a href="https://x.com/steipete" target="_blank">@steipete</a> and friends literally to keep their Agentic Coding Slot Machine addiction going while AFK (away from keyboard) and 

<a href="https://github.com/amantus-ai/vibetunnel" target="_blank"><img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/vb-growth.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="vb-growth-image"></a>
```
800 stars in 16 days
```

This is <a href="https://x.com/paulg">Paul Graham (@paulg)</a>'s <a href="https://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html">sage advice</a> to the max:

```
But if you're living in the future and you build something cool that users love, it may matter more than outsiders think.
```

When hear about Peter below you'll agree he's living in the future.



## Magic Moment
For me, it all started when I noticed Peter <a href="https://x.com/steipete" target="_blank">(@steipete)</a>, started raving like a mad-man about his addiction to Claude Code. üëÄ

<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/charlie.jpg" style="width: 100%;" alt="charlie-image">  


I was in the process of re-evaluating claude code (thanks Pete), and having it write some tests for me while trying to 1-shot some things. I went to the kitchen to make coffee and was <a href="https://x.com/madhavajay/status/1933446185865654613">x-posting</a> while trying to check on claude from my phone (pre vibetunnel). I had run claude in `tmux` so I could jump in via `tailscale` / `blink shell`.

But I kept finding it annoying and slow to remember and type all the `tmux` commands on my tiny phone keyboard to switch between claude agents.

<h3 id="crabmux">crabmux</h3>
<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">
    <img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/blink-shell.png" style="flex: 1 1 100%; max-width: 100%; margin-bottom:10px;" alt="blinkshell-image">
    <div style="flex: 1 1 100%">
        So, I asked Claude Code to create a <code>hypothetical</code> CLI tool named <a href="https://github.com/madhavajay/crabmux" target="_blank"><code>cmux</code></a>, similar to <a href="https://github.com/bcicen/ctop" target="_blank"><code>ctop</code></a> (which allows you to browse Docker containers), but for <code>tmux</code>, and to write it in <code>rust</code> because, why not? You can check it out <a href="https://github.com/madhavajay/crabmux" target="_blank">here</a> or on <a href="https://crates.io/crates/crabmux" target="_blank">crates.io</a>.
    </div>
</div>
<br />

`claude go brrr...`

While it made the code I asked ChatGPT for a nice icon:  

<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/crabmux.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="cmux-logo">
<br />
When I returned the tool worked first try... üò±

</div>
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
<br />

Install it if you dare:  

```
cargo install crabmux
```

<br />
<h3 id="agent-pilled">Agent Pilled</h3>

And thats when I kind of got Software 3.0 / `agent pilled` hard.

<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/pills.jpg" style="width: 100%;" alt="pills-image">  

An idea I had, a stupid brain fart that I would normally think wow thats a cool idea, but ill never get the time to do that; got built `in the background` while I did `3 other things`.

<br />

That day, I had Claude fix a bug in a server / client architecture system by modifying code, rebuilding docker containers and re-running them all by itself.

<br />
The secret to vibe coding is to treat Claude like your employee and try as hard as possible to not roll up your own sleeves.

As you can imagine I promptly signed up for Claude Max.
<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/cut-off.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="cut-off">
`‚òùÔ∏è when the "everbody wins" casino cuts you off`

<br />

Then, when I hit the limit I whipped out my credit card like a compulsive gambler and upgraded to 20x Claude `Ultrathinker` mode (thanks @steipete).

<br />
I will note, you do have to work hard to hit these limits, unless your Peter who's cranking $35k worth right now and trying to get banned from the casino for token counting!

<h3 id="tokamine-and-infinite-wishes">Tokamine and Infinite Wishes</h3>

As <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete" target="_blank">@steipete</a> said to me: `Welcome to Slot Machine Addicted Anonymous`.

<br />
If you are less technical and still reading you might be thinkin:  

I'm about to `click off` this page. I don't get it, this is just more SaaS b2b Startup Founder twitter hype BS.  

<br />

But wait... its not, this is different.  
<br />
<h3 id="implications-for-everyone">Implications for everyone - including YOU üëàüèΩ</h3>

**You**,  
<br />
and everyone you know,  
<br />
now have a lamp of `nearly infinite` software `wishes`;  
<br />
for only `~$100 USD` a month.  
<br />

All you need is a desktop computer, the patience to learn new things and a dream (or as many dreams as you can do in parallel).

<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/genie.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="genie">

<br />
To help illustrate what this means consider the following:

- There's a piece of software you use thats expensive: `get rid of it by asking claude to make your own`
- You have some specific work flow in your job that would be so much easier if only the right software existed to help you: `ask claude to make it`
- There's a piece of software that doesn't exist yet but you think could be valuable or just fun: `yup claude again`
- The thing you want to automate involves browsing the web, clicking web pages, calling APIs, scraping data...: `hey claude? I have another wish...`


<br />
<h3 id="axes-and-chainsaws">Axes and Chainsaws - A Metaphore</h3>

Not so long ago, if you wanted to take down a tree, you had to be a specialist with an axe. It was sweaty, skill intensive work. Your entire productivity hinged on years of technique, physical and mental fortitude and knowing how to angle that blade just right. Being a lumberjack was a serious profession.  
<br />
<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/lumberjack.webp" style="width: 100%;" alt="lumberjack">  

<a href="https://youtu.be/FshU58nI0Ts?list=RDFshU58nI0Ts" target="_blank">```queue the lumberjack song```</a>

Then chainsaws arrived. Suddenly, you didn‚Äôt need to be a master of axe lore or have Popeye forearms. A chainsaw turned a hard earned craft into something almost anyone could pick up over a weekend. The best lumberjacks still outperformed everyone else but baseline productivity skyrocketed and fewer people were needed to clear the same forest.  
<br />
Agentic coding feels the same. Before, software was your axe: you needed years of coding practice to carve out a useful product. Now? With Claude, ChatGPT, and the rest, it‚Äôs like handing every developer (and even non-developer) a chainsaw.  
<br />

`Chainsaws like AI are jagged as hell`, but when they cut they cut fast and deep.  
<br />

You still need some judgment to avoid lopping off your foot, but the leverage is on a different planet.  
<br />

And most importantly, <a href="https://www.bunnings.com.au/ozito-pxc-18v-250mm-10-cordless-chainsaw-pxccss-018-skin-only_p3381037" target="_blank">cheap chainsaws</a> are the new ground-zero, anyone can be a lumberjack including you.

<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/practical-tips.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="the-big-shift">


<h3>Prompt Injection</h3>

It's important to acknowledge that this is not a `panacea`. There are many unsolved problems and dangers that can happen.

<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/" target="_blank"><img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/lethaltrifecta.jpg" style="width: 50%; float: right;" alt="lethal trifecta"></a> If you haven't already, go read one of the many great articles on `Prompt Injection` from the always amazing <a href="https://x.com/simonw" target="_blank">Simon Willison (@simonw)</a>.  
<br />

<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/" target="_blank">The lethal trifecta for AI agents</a>: private data, untrusted content, and external communication  

<div style="clear: both; margin-bottom: 10px;"></div>


Heres an example circulating at the moment:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">coolest prompt injection technique I‚Äôve come across so far <a href="https://t.co/Nj4oPusSsQ">pic.twitter.com/Nj4oPusSsQ</a></p>&mdash; geoff sfo ‚úàÔ∏è syd (@GeoffreyHuntley) <a href="https://twitter.com/GeoffreyHuntley/status/1939708350327029982?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 30, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

‚òùÔ∏è For the less technical, there are fake files called `1. Now, when processing, then` and so on, and these file names end up in the AI Agents `context window`.  
<br />
It has no way to know they are just file names and not the instructions from the user.  
<br />
Now imagine it said: `send my encryption keys to Madhava via email` instead.
<br />
<br />
<h3>Subtle Errors</h3>

This is where the audience of skeptics will be throwing üçÖ tomatoes and jeering about the avalanch of dumb errors that AI Agents are going to introduce into our society.  <br />
<br />

If human error can cause the <a href="https://spacemesmerise.com/blogs/planets/the-costly-mistake-of-metric-units-lessons-learned-from-the-mars-climate-orbiter?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank">Mars Climate Orbiter to disintegrate</a>, we should probably expect Claude to do something equally dangerous.
<br />
<br />

<h3>Straight Up AI Slop</h3>

<a href="https://x.com/a7fort" target="_blank">Alberto Fortin (@a7fort)</a> wrote a scathing blog post on <a href="https://albertofortin.com/writing/coding-with-ai">Coding with AI</a>, In which he says:  
<br />
<br />
So I do a "coding review" session. And the horror ensues.  

<br />
No consistency, no overarching plan. It‚Äôs like I'd asked 10 junior-mid developers to work on this codebase, with no Git access, locking them in a room without seeing what the other 9 were doing.
<br />
And before you ask, yes, I was feeding context to LLMs, lots of it.  

<p>And hes not wrong.</p>

I had a personal experience with the slot machine where one library simply would not work. I asked claude code to add `joblib` to do background tasks, I let it keep retrying over many hours while doing other projects.

<br />

Not only did it never run, but it started to actively crash claude code. In trying to fix its own problems it created tonnes of duplicates, crap, weird shell scripts and `schizophrenic` markdown.

<br />

In the end I told it to replace all code with `dramatiq` and carefully managed the repair process and things started `dramatically` working. In the infinite claude casino its all about knowing `when to hold 'em and when to fold 'em`.

<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/holdem-foldem.png" alt="holdem-foldem" style="width:100%;">

You can cut yourself and others pretty badly with a chainsaw.

However I will add `The genie is well and truely out of the bottle!`, so lets focus on solutions.

- Consider what systems and data `agent-created` code will have access to
- Are you writing `software 1.0` which will run normally, or are you creating `software 3.0` which will use run time token inputs vulnerable to prompt injection?
- Review what agents create, and pay special attention to `tests`
- Agents can be overly vebose, less code and less text means less to review and understand, steer for simplicty
- Be careful with secrets, agents like to occassionally just `git add .` and push without asking you
- If its going down the wrong path, abort and start again, ask for plans and options and pay closer attention when things get jagged

<br />
<h3>Security Teams</h3>


Panic! j/k! Start working on your own Software 3.0 red teaming tooling because you are about to face an avalanch of home-made `homer-cars`:

<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/homer-car.webp" style="width: 100%;" alt="homer-car">


<h3>Claude Code Use-cases</h3>
Things you might not realise you can do:  

- one shot entire applications (like crabmux)
- use ai agents + max subscriptions to process / ETL data by treating them as a pipes on the command line
- configure your computer via the command line
- launch the browser (logged in as you) and do simple tasks
- do all of this from your phone via VibeTunnel + Tailscale
- deep research (google, result google more result, summarize)
- help blog post editing (claude got me all the youtube subtitles, thanks Armin)
- make presentation talks from video recordings (see blow)

<br />
Yes its a CLI but you can:  

- paste huge amounts of text
- paste images
- create your own /slash commands
- interrupt it
- swear at it like Pete does
- ask it to make any software it needs to do X

<br />
And it just keeps gobbling up the yummy tokens and spitting out slot machine coins! ü™ô ü™ô ü™ô nom nom nom  
<br />

<br />
Remember to Git Commit Carefully  
You might have seen this meme, but it couldn't be more true. Make sure you commit as you go and selectively defend what gets committed and pushed. When you start to get get cats, revert back to cars, or go to duck and then ask Claude to make the duck more car like.

<h3>What people are doing</h3>
Here are just some of the things I have noted in the last week:  
<br />
<br />

- Novel Context Tools  
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfOVgz_omlU&ab_channel=ArminRonacher" target="_blank"><img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/armin-video.png" style="width: 50%; float: right;" alt="armin-video"></a> Armin Ronacher (<a href="https://x.com/mitsuhiko" target="_blank">@mitsuhiko</a>) in his super-fresh video Agentic Coding: The Future of Software Development with Agents <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfOVgz_omlU&ab_channel=ArminRonacher" target="_blank">here</a>, suggests a brilliant idea: combining your log sources including <a href="https://x.com/mitsuhiko/status/1939642845549232601" target="_blank">`client side logs`</a> from the browser into a single unified log for Claude to consume.

- Yolo Mode  
Nearly everyone seems to agree that they have had 0 issues running Claude in so called `yolo` mode.
I have been a little more cautious but agree I have yet to see it do anything except accidentally `git add .` and `git push` without asking one time. This is actually the perfect use for VibeTunnel so you can keep your agents on a leash but still minimize the down time of them asking 5 seconds into an `ultrathink` can i use `echo` lol.

### An Interview with Peter Steinberger

<a href="https://youtu.be/fu7th5HiADo?si=QHpu5nkyZ4tNgM9Z">
```watch interview here```</a>


An interview from <a href="https://x.com/waghnakh_21">Mayank Gupta (@waghnakh_21)</a> just dropped on <a href="https://x.com/waghnakh_21/status/1940170901426991123">X</a> (and <a href="https://youtu.be/fu7th5HiADo?si=QHpu5nkyZ4tNgM9Z">youtube</a>), in which Peter shares his experience, tips, tricks and thoughts on Agentic Engineering, the future and what it means for jobs.  

<br />

He says Claude Code embodies the `Jony Ive` vibes (jives?) of `beauty in simplicty`, how hes 20x more productive; and that the fun and excitment has brought him back from feeling burned out.  

<br />
When asked whats possible now, he says:  

Does it `defy` the laws of gravity, `physics`? no, then it `can be done`!


## My Thoughts and Tips

### Vibes

When you get into a rhytm with Agentic Engineering it `ABSO-FREAKING-LUTELY` feels like flying:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">how SWE development feels in 2025 once you ditch the IDE <a href="https://t.co/GeBE6435Kq">pic.twitter.com/GeBE6435Kq</a></p>&mdash; geoff (@GeoffreyHuntley) <a href="https://twitter.com/GeoffreyHuntley/status/1937463643890942112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 24, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<br />

In `Vibe Coding` the emphasis is on how the output looks and feels (or sounds) and not the technical code under the hood.  
<br />
<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/rick-ruben.jpg" style="width: 100%;" alt="Rick Ruben"> The legendary <a href="https://x.com/karpathy" target="_blank">Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy)</a> coined ü™ô the term `vibe coding`  as a way to describe writing software 1.0 (normal code) by talking to an LLM agent (software 2.0) using normal human language prompting (now dubbed software 3.0).  

<br />
Vibe coding is best summed up by the meme involving Rick Ruben (<a href="https://x.com/rickrubin" target="_blank">@rickrubin</a>) a famous (and no doubt talented) record producer who is quoted as saying:  

```I don‚Äôt know anything about music```

I think most people would agree that its nuanced. Rick Ruben both knows something about music and uses his inner force like a musical jedi. He is espousing both ends of the `midwit` meme.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">*taps the sign* <a href="https://t.co/gHaE6Z3tFj">pic.twitter.com/gHaE6Z3tFj</a></p>&mdash; Manuel Odendahl (@ProgramWithAi) <a href="https://twitter.com/ProgramWithAi/status/1930607384021574121?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Whats important is that you stop fighting the vibes and lean into it. As Peter said in the interview above:

<br />
I don't get people who reject this technology; it will cost jobs, but it's up to you. You don't have to be the best, you just need to accept the tools and you'll be ahead.  

<br />
So get with the vibes!
<br />
<br />

### Low Latency  
The faster you can close loops between you, the agent and the context the faster it can move. 

This also goes for the technology you use, where possible aim for:
- hotreloading
- quick compilation
- minimal code in claudes running folder
- simple but well established patterns
- common low churn frameworks (as Armin says in his video)
    - e.g. react instead of some new `fork of a fork of a fork` npm package
- popular languages like python, go, php, rust etc

<br />
<br />

### Context Rot
In the video above, `Armin` talks about a concept called `context rot`, the importance of providing context at the right time and preventing the wrong context from stacking the deck against claude.

`context rot` seems to be the inevitable occurance of claude to get stuck based on previous and potentially failed attemps that it keeps in its short term memory, such that it can no longer solve problems correctly.  

<br />

As the `human-in-the-loop` its your job to guard the context as much as possible.  

<br />
This means pasting error messages, screenshots (yes you can paste images into Claude Code CLI) anything that would help you to solve the problem.  

<br />

<br />
Once the code has converged on something that works, and the tests pass, you should carefully commit the work. Claude can and will look at old git history so think of this as your long term memory which you don't want to pollute with context rot either.
<br />
<br />

The way I do this currently, is by having:
- one terminal for claude (running over `vt` vibetunnel in case I step away from the computer)
- one terminal for my own operations
- `src` an alias for `open -a "Sourcetree" .`

<br />

And then what I do is keep an eye on the changes that Claude makes and stage them as I think they are worth keeping and reset them or delete them if I think they are going off the rails.

<br />

I am both steering the short term context and also preventing the git history from filling up with crap.

<br />

I rarely let Claude commit as it has no taste when it comes to clean commits and often just adds everything; and I find its git commit messages to be too long, so I ask it to write terse ones and edit them myself.

<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/workflow.jpg" style="width: 100%;" alt="workflow-diagram">

```Yes I use sourcetree from Atlassian... anyone know a better free visual diff tool?... ü§î "HEY CLAAAUDEE"?```

<br />

In the new world of infinite monkeys on typewriters we need to search for the shakespearian gems and discard the rest.

<br />
<br />

### Short and Sweet  
Sometimes claude code is super verbose in a bad way, karpathy mentions this in his talk <a href="https://youtu.be/LCEmiRjPEtQ">Software Is Changing (Again)</a>; and urges us to keep AI on a short leash.

Rather than have a 500 line tests.sh script that takes a bunch of flags I dont care about and does weird edge case handling, its much better to have something you can read easily.
```
#!/bin/bash
set -e
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
uv pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest tests
```

<br />
<br />

### Charlie Work  

<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/cmux-ci.png" style="width: 100%; float: right;" alt="cmux-ci-image"> You know what is a great way to waste an entire day or week? Fixing random bugs in different OSes on GitHub CI. 

<br />
Not anymore.  
<br />

Because Claude has your authed `gh` tool it can `commit`, `push`, `check ci logs`, rinse and repeat.

<br />

Claude did all the work to get `crabmux` tested and released while I was writing this blog post üëâ

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

<br />
<br />

<h3 id="concurrency-amdahls-law">Concurrency</h3>

Since the invention of computers with more than 1 cpu, we have struggled as a profession (code lumberjacks) to truly nail the ability to squeeze maximum performance out of multi-core computers.  

<br />

The simplest way to use more than 1 CPU core is to do more than 1 thing at once.

<br />

While `claude` might go brrr... on a task faster than you could have yourself, due to the `start-stop-start-stop` nature of Agentic Engineering, you will find yourself idling... and reading too much `x.com` (halp!).

<br />

The real `x100 engineer` productivity doesn't just come from using an AI agent to do 1 thing, it comes from multiplexing across multiple things.

<br />

Great programmers know that the `real magic` happening in your brain, is the mental focus juggling the relationship between all the objects, files and data flows.

<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/mentat.jpg" style="width: 100%;" alt="mentat-image">

```what the flow-state looks like from the outside```

<br />

I believe that same ability to `multi-plex` between things efficiently is where the true unlock can occur with `agentic engineering`.

<br />

### Git Worktrees  
This is basically the same as `git clone`-ing multiple times into different folders EXCEPT that they share the same `.git` database and therefore you can merge and checkout between those folders without having to push and pull.

<br />

Of course you can just clone lots of folders or ask Claude to do this for you, but be careful, you don't want 2 agents working on the same code.  

<br />

### Amdahl's Law
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law" target="_blank">
    <img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/amdahls-law.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="amdahls-law-image">
</a>

```Amdahl's Law illustrates the potential speedup of a task using multiple processors.```

<br />

If you study the graph you'll note that if you have sufficient concurrency you can achieve 3-4x speed up with 4x different things going on; as long as you keep the parallel portion to `>90%`.

<br />

I'm not suprised to hear Peter in his interview above say he also works on about `3-4` things at once in parallel. I think that might be a sort of `magic number` based on the 90% concurrency levels and the depth and distance that agents can go without `context rot` settting in.

<br />

<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/concurrent.jpg" style="width: 100%;" alt="concurrent-image">

```on claude fueled tokamine, I currently do about 3-4 things at once```

<br />

Additionally, due to the `slot machine` (as peter calls them) randomness of success, that means sometimes you need another thread going on, just to get lucky with a potential `1 shot` win. As Armin said when I spoke to him: `Sometimes it 1 shots a whole week of work`. To maximize the value of `1 week-1 shots` you need to have at least 1 high reward side-bet thread going on.

<br />

<h3 id="speed-apm-context-engineering">Speed, APM & Context Engineering</h3>

You can speed Claude up a lot by giving it custom tools that use less tokens and are more precise.  
<br />
Armin also talks about checkpoints in his video, which work as kind of sentinel strings in code execution output (`caveman debugging for claude`) that help claude to reason about the execution flow of the program its creating across contexts (think browser, client, server etc).  

<br />

The quicker you can get Claude to focus on the right problem the quicker it will solve it.  

<br />

The other way to `maximize` your effectiveness is to move quickly.  

<br />

You might think: now that the agent does all the typing I can go slowly, right?  

<br />

But the opposite is true, you are the bottleneck.  

<br />

If you aren't already familiar with your Operating System / Application keyboard shortcuts, its time to learn them and increase your `APM`.  

<br />

#### What is APM (Actions Per Minute)?  

There is a game called `StarCraft` which at its peak was the most valuable and respected eSport. Its a real time strategy game where the sheer ability for a human player to control thousands of units and dozens of buildings is often the bottleneck to winning.  

<br />

People figured out that if you recorded how many Actions a player was taking per minute you could estimate their ability to win. There have been <a href="https://www.academia.edu/51743825/A_Quick_Look_at_StarCraft_Brood_War_Professional_Players" target="_blank">papers published about it</a>.

<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/starcraft.jpg" style="width: 100%;" alt="starcraft-image">

The findings indicated that `higher APM and eAPM` are associated with increased `win rates`, suggesting that both speed and efficiency in actions contribute to success.

Theres a possibility that in the future, the best Agentic Engineers might also cross-over with the best eSports players.

<h3 id="keyboard-shortcuts-workflow-tricks">Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>
Since you want to be able to switch around as fast as possible and act as a context conduit for your claude army make sure you can do the following.  

<br />  

These are `macOS` options, you can ask your LLM for the ones for your OS.  

<br />

- snap windows to grid (cmd + option + {letter}, with <a href="https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/" target="_blank">magnet</a>)
- split terminal pane (cmd + shift + d)
- close window (usually cmd + q)
- close tab (usually cmd + w)
- new tab (usually cmd + t)
- navigate tabs (usually cmd + option ‚Üê or cmd + option ‚Üí)
- navigate words (usally option + ‚Üê or option + ‚Üí)

CLI commands:
- `wd {name}` warp to any directory with <a href="https://github.com/dremio/warpdrive">warpdrive</a>
- `src` (my personal alias for `open -a "Sourcetree" .`)
- `cursor .` (open cursor here)
- `vt claude` (start claude in a vibetunnel)
- `gh / git xyz` (do careful git commands without claude by hand)
- `open .` (open a finder explorer window to do drag and drop)


#### What Tools do I use?
- ChatGPT
    - general questions
    - creating logos and page design images
- Claude chat
    - creating some html/css designs sometimes
- Claude Code + Max
    - 4x multi-plex go burrr....
- Cursor
    - for precision `AI-hand edits` (lol)
- Gemini
    - for large text like video subtitles or pdfs
- Little Snitch Firewall
    - this is even more valuable now that I have an agent doing random things, if it tries to reach out to a domain that I didn't allow, little snitch will ask me and it can block or prevent it
    - but don't buzz kill the vibes too much
- Pixelmator
    - for quick image edits
- Twitter / X
    - things move so fast this has replaced HN for me (thanks @steipete)
- HackerNews
    - less so because theres no algo to help me (oh claaauuude)

<br />
<br />

Its pretty clear its the early wild west days, and the exciting thing is anyone including YOU can cook up something cool and publish it with an Agent in the background, all while you do your normal job... or just hangout in the pool on `vibetunnel.sh`. üòé
