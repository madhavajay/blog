<h3 id="what-changed-the-tectonic-shift">What Changed? The Trifecta:</h3>

<br />
<h3>1) AYCE (all you can eat) API Token plans (Claude Max)</h3>

<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/claude-max.jpg" style="width: 50%; float: right;" alt="claude-max">
While not strictly unlimited, it has a hard cap. The reality is without hardcaps the human mind always reverts to a scarcity mentality. Without fear of scarey bills the community have moved like lightning to suddenly adopt these tools.


<div style="clear: both; margin-bottom: 10px;"></div>

<h3>2) Claude 4 (and other models) have crossed a threshold</h3>

Yes, this applies to Gemini 2.5 Pro and a few others too, the recent CoT (chain of thought) + subagent planning abilities of frontier models get things right `so often now`, you no longer doubt they can do something in `1-shot` (first try).

For instance, the excellent <a href="https://x.com/GeoffreyHuntley/" target="_blank">@GeoffreyHuntley</a> has been vibe tweeting non-stop about his army of agents writing a brand new programming language called `cursed`:  

<div style="transform: scale(0.6); transform-origin: top left; height:400px;">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">500 AI subagents making a compiler afk whilst i fly internationally to sfo <a href="https://t.co/wxkhP5nUjF">https://t.co/wxkhP5nUjF</a></p>&mdash; geoff (@GeoffreyHuntley) <a href="https://twitter.com/GeoffreyHuntley/status/1933660332670828544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 13, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div>

The thing is this level of insanity is only really possible when you have ‚òùÔ∏è all you can eat tokens, unless you're a fan of bankruptcy level AWS bills.

<h3>3) Optimal Workflow tools like Claude Code and Vibe Tunnel</h3>

Cursor is great (they just added a mobile mode), but its an IDE for humans, when you finally `grok` using something like Claude Code you realise all the advantages of an `agent-first` UI. By forcing you off the tools, you learn to rise up the stack and `multi-plex` your efforts across agents and projects. 

Plus, by being text only, it lets you `multi-plex` across time and space too. 

As Peter says in his recent interview with the awesome <a href="https://x.com/waghnakh_21">Mayank Gupta (@waghnakh_21)</a> (below), Cursors system prompt is optimzied for the user to pick context. Claude on the otherhand is excellent at finding and using the right context itself and is context / token hungry (why you need AYCE tokens).

Also something that has come up in conversations is theres a certain `je ne sais quoi` ineffable quality to running a local agent on your machine which beats the cloud agents.

For Peter and many others you just can't get the same MacOS versions or access to real hardware to do real Apple development. I imagine the same applies to things like Windows or any kind of complex IoT / custom hardware. 

Something Armin and I spoke about was this `ineffable` feeling that is different between using `claude code` locally, and having some Cloud AI agent like `devin` or `jules` just open a PR on its own.

When you use `claude code` locally, I would describe it as `feeling` as though you are "In the room" when the code was made. You were there through success and failure collaborating with the agent and so you feel attached emotionally to the artifacts it produces.

When that happens 100% automatically, and its `too magical`, it crosses the uncanny valley into weird killer robot mode and triggers your NIH (not invented here) senses really hard.

It feels the same way when someone says "look at this AI thing I just made". Your instinct is to call it `slop`. Perhaps this a tribal human thing but I think how human-agent interactions feel is critical to them being useful and trustworthy.

Real work is done via the Personal Laptop / Desktop with a human-in-the-loop and that isn't likely to change any time soon.

Claude Code is so good, that it no surprise for me to wake up mid-writing this blog post and read as reported by <a href="https://x.com/swyx">@swyz</a> that the lead developers of Claude Code just got poached (meta barbarians at the gate style) by <a href="https://x.com/cursor_ai">@cursor_ai</a>: <br />
<a href="https://x.com/swyx/status/1940124280249020567"><img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/cursor-claude.jpeg" style="width: 50%;" alt="cursor-claude-image"></a>


It is these three things which have now kick started a crazy movement. 

As we speak, myself and others are literally `vibe coding` 4 projects at once, at 20x effectiveness from bed, or the supermarket; or the pool!

<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/my-vibes.jpg" style="width: 30%;" alt="my-vibes">  

```Me vibe coding from home with VibeTunnel``` 

With <a href="https://vibetunnel.sh/" target="_blank">VibeTunnel.sh</a> you can now have 24/7 access to `claude code` on your desktop computer from your phone. Thats your IP, your login credentials, your code repos, MCP servers everything to be maximally productive. This is an important difference with online only tools like <a href="https://devin.ai/" target="_blank">devin</a>, <a href="https://jules.google/" target="_blank">jules</a> etc.

VibeTunnnel was created by <a href="https://x.com/steipete" target="_blank">@steipete</a> and friends literally to keep their Agentic Coding Slot Machine addiction going while AFK (away from keyboard).


<h3 id="i-was-wrong-about-claude-code">I was wrong about Claude Code</h3>

Like many others, I tried `claude code` months ago when it came out, put in my anthropic `api key` and watched it spin its wheels üõû so hard it burnt around `15 dollars` worth of API tokens and turned my git repo into an AI slop mud pit. 

My immediate thought was, nice try üòú but no thanks, back to Cursor.

But I was wrong.

## Magic Moment
It kind of all started when I noticed a person I have followed for a long time on Twitter (from my iOS hey days), the amazing Peter Steinberger aka <a href="https://x.com/steipete" target="_blank">@steipete</a>, started raving like a mad-man about his addiction to Claude Code. üëÄ

<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/charlie.jpg" style="width: 70%;" alt="charlie-image">  


So I thought i'd try it again (thanks Pete). I was in the process of re-evaluating claude code, having it write some tests for me and trying to 1-shot some things. I went to the kitchen to make coffee and was <a href="https://x.com/madhavajay/status/1933446185865654613">x-posting</a> and trying to check on claude from my phone. I had ran claude in `tmux` so I could jump in via `tailscale` / `blink shell`.

But I kept finding it annoying and slow to remember and type all the `tmux` commands on my tiny phone keyboard.

<h3 id="crabmux">crabmux</h3>
<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/blink-shell.png" style="float:right; width:45%; margin-left:10px;" alt="blinkshell-image">
<div style="float:left; width:45%;">So, I asked Claude Code to create a  <code>hypothetical</code> CLI tool named <a href="https://github.com/madhavajay/crabmux" target="_blank"><code>cmux</code></a>, similar to <a href="https://github.com/bcicen/ctop" target="_blank"><code>ctop</code></a> (which allows you to browse Docker containers), but for <code>tmux</code>, and to write it in <code>Rust</code> because, why not? You can check it out <a href="https://github.com/madhavajay/crabmux" target="_blank">here</a> or on <a href="https://crates.io/crates/crabmux" target="_blank">crates.io</a>. üëâ
<br /><br />

`claude go brrr...`

While it made the code I asked ChatGPT for a nice icon:  

<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/crabmux.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="cmux-logo">
<br />
When I returned the tool worked first try... üò±

</div>
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
<br />

Install it if you dare:

```
cargo install crabmux

# or 

curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/madhavajay/crabmux/main/install.sh | bash
```

<h3 id="agent-pilled">Agent Pilled</h3>

And thats when I kind of got Software 3.0 / `agent pilled` hard.

<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/pills.jpg" style="width: 50%;" alt="pills-image">  

An idea I had, a stupid brain fart that I would normally think wow thats a cool idea, but ill never get the time to do that; got built `in the background` while I did `3 other things`.

That day, I had Claude debug and fix a bug in a server / client architecture system by modifying code, rebuilding docker containers and re-running them all by itself.

The secret to vibe coding is to treat Claude like your employee and try as hard as possible to not roll up your own sleeves.

As you can imagine I promptly signed up for Claude Max.
<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/cut-off.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="cut-off">
`‚òùÔ∏è when the "everbody wins" casino cuts you off`

Then, when I hit the limit I whipped out my credit card like a compulsive gambler and upgraded to 20x Claude `Ultrathinker` mode (thanks @steipete).

I will note, you do have to work hard to hit these limits, unless your Peter who's cranking $35k worth right now and trying to get banned from the casino for token counting!

<h3 id="tokamine-and-infinite-wishes">Tokamine and Infinite Wishes</h3>

As <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete" target="_blank">@steipete</a> said to me: `"Welcome to Slot Machine Addicted Anonymous"`.

If you are less technical and still reading you might be thinkin: `I'm about click off this page, I don't get it, this is just more SaaS b2b Startup Founder twitter hype BS.`

But wait... its not, this is different.

<h3 id="implications-for-everyone">Implications for everyone - including YOU üëàüèΩ</h3>

```
You,
and everyone you know,

now have a lamp of nearly infinite software wishes;

for only ~$100 USD a month.

All you need is a desktop computer, the patience to learn new things and a dream (or as many dreams as you can do in parallel).

<!-- <img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/genie2.png" style="width: 50%;" alt="genie"> -->


To help illustrate what this means consider the following:
- There's a piece of software you use thats expensive: `get rid of it by asking claude to make your own`
- You have some specific work flow in your job that would be so much easier if only the right software existed to help you: `ask claude to make it`
- There's a piece of software that doesn't exist yet but you think could be valuable or just fun: `yup claude again`
- The thing you want to automate involves browsing the web, clicking web pages, calling APIs, scraping data...: `hey claude? I have another wish...`


<h3 id="axes-and-chainsaws">Axes and Chainsaws - A Metaphore</h3>

Not so long ago, if you wanted to take down a tree, you had to be a specialist with an axe. It was sweaty, skill intensive work. Your entire productivity hinged on years of technique, physical and mental fortitude and knowing how to angle that blade just right. Being a lumberjack was a serious profession.

<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/lumberjack.webp" style="width: 50%;" alt="lumberjack">  

<a href="https://youtu.be/FshU58nI0Ts?list=RDFshU58nI0Ts" target="_blank">```queue the lumberjack song```</a>

Then chainsaws arrived. Suddenly, you didn‚Äôt need to be a master of axe lore or have Popeye forearms. A chainsaw turned a hard earned craft into something almost anyone could pick up over a weekend. The best lumberjacks still outperformed everyone else but baseline productivity skyrocketed and fewer people were needed to clear the same forest.

Agentic coding feels the same. Before, software was your axe: you needed years of coding practice to carve out a useful product. Now? With Claude, ChatGPT, and the rest, it‚Äôs like handing every developer (and even non-developer) a chainsaw.

`Chainsaws like AI are jagged as hell`, but when they cut they cut fast and deep.

You still need some judgment to avoid lopping off your foot, but the leverage is on a different planet.

And most importantly, <a href="https://www.bunnings.com.au/ozito-pxc-18v-250mm-10-cordless-chainsaw-pxccss-018-skin-only_p3381037" target="_blank">cheap chainsaws</a> are the new ground-zero, anyone can be a lumberjack including you.

<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/practical-tips.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="the-big-shift">


<h3>Prompt Injection</h3>

Its important to acknowledge that this is not a `panacea`. There are many unsolved problems and dangers that can happen.

<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/" target="_blank"><img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/lethaltrifecta.jpg" style="width: 50%; float: right;" alt="lethal trifecta"></a> If you haven't already, go read one of the many great articles on `Prompt Injection` from the always amazing <a href="https://x.com/simonw" target="_blank">Simon Willison (@simonw)</a>.

<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/" target="_blank">The lethal trifecta for AI agents</a>: private data, untrusted content, and external communication  

<div style="clear: both; margin-bottom: 10px;"></div>


Heres an example circulating at the moment:
<div style="transform: scale(0.6); transform-origin: top left; height:320px;">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">coolest prompt injection technique I‚Äôve come across so far <a href="https://t.co/Nj4oPusSsQ">pic.twitter.com/Nj4oPusSsQ</a></p>&mdash; geoff sfo ‚úàÔ∏è syd (@GeoffreyHuntley) <a href="https://twitter.com/GeoffreyHuntley/status/1939708350327029982?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 30, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div>

‚òùÔ∏è For the less technical, there are fake files called `1. Now, when processing, then` and so on, and these file names end up in the AI Agents `context window`. It has no way to know they are just file names and not the instructions from the user.

Now imagine it said: `"send my encryption keys to Madhava via email"` instead.

<h3>Subtle Errors</h3>
This is where the audience of skeptics will be throwing üçÖ tomatoes and jeering about the avalanch of dumb errors that AI Agents are going to introduce into our society.  <br />
<br />

If human error can cause the <a href="https://spacemesmerise.com/blogs/planets/the-costly-mistake-of-metric-units-lessons-learned-from-the-mars-climate-orbiter?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank">Mars Climate Orbiter to disintegrate</a>, we should probably expect Claude to do something equally dangerous.

However I will add `The genie is well and truely out of the bottle!`, so lets focus on solutions.

- Consider what systems and data `agent-created` code will have access to
- Are you writing `software 1.0` which will run normally, or are you creating `software 3.0` which will use run time token inputs vulnerable to prompt injection?
- Review what agents create, and pay special attention to `tests`
- Agents can be overly vebose, less code and less text means less to review and understand, steer for simplicty
- Be careful with secrets, agents like to occassionally just `git add .` and push without asking you


<h3>Security Teams</h3>

Panic! j/k! Start working on your own Software 3.0 red teaming tooling because you are about to face an avalanch of home-made `homer-cars`:
<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/homer-car.webp" style="width: 50%;" alt="homer-car">


<h3>Claude Code Use-cases</h3>
Things you might not realise you can do:  

- one shot entire applications (like crabmux)
- use ai agents + max subscriptions to process / ETL data by treating them as a pipes on the command line
- configure your computer via the command line
- launch the browser (logged in as you) and do simple tasks
- do all of this from your phone via VibeTunnel + Tailscale
- deep research (google, result google more result, summarize)
- help blog post editing (claude got me all the youtube subtitles)
- make presentation talks from video recordings (see blow)

Yes its a CLI but you can:
- paste huge amounts of text
- paste images
- create your own /slash commands
- interrupt it
- swear at it like Pete does

And it just keeps gobbling up the yummy tokens and spitting out slot machine coins!


<h3>What people are doing</h3>
Here are just some of the things I have noted in the last week:  
<br />
<br />

- Novel Context Tools  
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfOVgz_omlU&ab_channel=ArminRonacher" target="_blank"><img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/armin-video.png" style="width: 50%; float: right;" alt="armin-video"></a> Armin Ronacher (<a href="https://x.com/mitsuhiko" target="_blank">@mitsuhiko</a>) in his super-fresh video Agentic Coding: The Future of Software Development with Agents <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfOVgz_omlU&ab_channel=ArminRonacher" target="_blank">here</a>, suggests a brilliant idea: combining your log sources including <a href="https://x.com/mitsuhiko/status/1939642845549232601" target="_blank">`client side logs`</a> from the browser into a single unified log for Claude to consume. Claude even published it for him to <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-console-forward-plugin" target="_blank">`npm` here vite-console-forward-plugin</a>.

- Replacing MCP  
With the power of Agentic Code generation MCP feels like Software 1.0 in a Software 3.0 world, and <a href="https://x.com/@ProgramWithAi">Manuel Odendahl's (@ProgramWithAi)</a> been working on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3oJqan2Gv8&ab_channel=AIEngineer">1 MCP to rule them all with his Agent Function Genie</a> idea. (Manuel can I have access?)
    

- Vibin all the Tunnels  
Peter is `multi-plexing` 3-4 projects at once 16-20 hours a day like a mad-man and one of those is the amazing VibeTunnel.sh <a href="https://vibetunnel.sh/">https://vibetunnel.sh/</a>. It gives you SSH access to your machine from anywhere in a web browser or native app interface ALL FOR FREE. Bye bye overpriced SSH Subscription Apps (looking at you blink shell).

- Making Video Talks  
<a href="https://x.com/badlogicgames">Mario Zechner</a> is usign claude code to record Video Talks! Love it.
<div style="transform: scale(0.6); transform-origin: top left; height:250px;">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">How I use Claude Code to help me record video talks.

- ChatGPT style Context Sharing  
Mario also worked on a context sharing tool like ChatGPT: <a href="https://mariozechner.at/uploads/yakety-claude.html" target="_blank">context sharer</a>


- Claude Controls your Browser  
The legendary <a href="https://x.com/simonw/status/1940197916267986946">Simon willion</a> explains on his blog <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/claude-code/playwright-mcp-claude-code">how to add playwright correctly to claude code</a>. TL;DR: Run this before you start "claude":
```claude mcp add playwright npx '@playwright/mcp@latest'```
<!--

 -->


- Git Commit Carefully  
You might have seen this meme, but it couldn't be more true. Make sure you commit as you go and selectively defend what gets committed and pushed. When you start to get get cats, revert back to cars, or go to duck and then ask Claude to make the duck more car like.

- Yolo Mode  
Nearly everyone seems to agree that they have had 0 issues running Claude in so called `yolo` mode.
I have been a little more cautious but agree I have yet to see it do anything except accidentally `git add .` and `git push` without asking one time. This is actually the perfect use for VibeTunnel so you can keep your agents on a leash but still minimize the down time of them asking 5 seconds into an `ultrathink` can i use `"echo"` lol.

An interview from <a href="https://x.com/waghnakh_21">Mayank Gupta (@waghnakh_21)</a> just dropped on <a href="https://x.com/waghnakh_21/status/1940170901426991123">X</a> (and <a href="https://youtu.be/fu7th5HiADo?si=QHpu5nkyZ4tNgM9Z">youtube</a>), in which Peter shares his experience, tips, tricks and thoughts on Agentic Engineering, the future and what it means for jobs.

He says Claude Code embodies the `Jony Ive` vibes (jives?) of `beauty in simplicty`, how hes 20x more productive; that the fun and excitment has brought him back from feeling burned out.

When asked whats possible now, he says:   
`"does it defy the laws of gravity, physics? no, then it can be done"`!

## My Thoughts and Tips

### Vibes

When you get into a rhytm with Agentic Engineering it ABSO-FREAKING-LUTELY feels like flying:
<div style="transform: scale(0.6); transform-origin: top left; height:450px;">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">how SWE development feels in 2025 once you ditch the IDE <a href="https://t.co/GeBE6435Kq">pic.twitter.com/GeBE6435Kq</a></p>&mdash; geoff (@GeoffreyHuntley) <a href="https://twitter.com/GeoffreyHuntley/status/1937463643890942112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 24, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div>
<br />

Its like washing dishes with a washing machine. Its like vacuuming with a robot vacuum. Its like washing clothes with a washing machine. Can you imagine doing any of those things without robots again?



In `Vibe Coding` the emphasis is on how the output looks and feels (or sounds) and not the technical code under the hood.

<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/rick-ruben.jpg" style="width: 50%; float: right;" alt="Rick Ruben"> The legendary <a href="https://x.com/karpathy" target="_blank">Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy)</a> coined ü™ô the term `vibe coding`  as a way to describe writing software 1.0 (normal code) by talking to an LLM agent (software 2.0) using normal human language prompting (now dubbed software 3.0). 

Vibe coding is best summed up by the meme involving Rick Ruben (<a href="https://x.com/rickrubin" target="_blank">@rickrubin</a>) a famous (and no doubt talented) record producer who is quoted as saying:  
```I don‚Äôt know anything about music```

I think most people would agree that its nuanced. Rick Ruben both knows something about music and uses his inner force like a musical jedi. He is espousing both ends of the `midwit` meme.

<div style="transform: scale(0.6); transform-origin: top left; height:400px;">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">*taps the sign* <a href="https://t.co/gHaE6Z3tFj">pic.twitter.com/gHaE6Z3tFj</a></p>&mdash; Manuel Odendahl (@ProgramWithAi) <a href="https://twitter.com/ProgramWithAi/status/1930607384021574121?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div>

Whats important is that you stop fighting the vibes and lean into it. As Peter said in the interview above:

```I don't get people who reject this technology; it will cost jobs, but it's up to you. You don't have to be the best, you just need to accept the tools and you'll be ahead.```

So get with the vibes!

### Low Latency
The faster you can close loops between you, the agent and the context the faster it can move. 

This also goes for the technology you use, where possible aim for:
- hotreloading
- quick compilation
- minimal code in claudes running folder
- simple but well established patterns
- common low churn frameworks (as Armin says in his video)
    - e.g. react instead of some new `fork of a fork of a fork` npm package
- popular languages like python, go, php, rust etc

<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/holdem-foldem.png" alt="holdem-foldem" style="float: right; width: 45%; margin-left:10px;">

I had a personal experience with the slot machine where one library simply would not work. I asked claude code to add `joblib` to do background tasks, I let it keep retrying over many hours while doing other projects. Not only did it never run, but it started to actively crash claude code.

In the end I told it to replace all code with `dramatiq` and things `dramatically` started working. In the infinite claude casino its all about knowing `when to hold 'em and when to fold 'em`.




### Context Rot
In the video above, `Armin` talks about a concept he dubs `context rot`, the importance of providing context at the right time and preventing the wrong context from stacking the deck against claude.

`context rot` seems to be the inevitable occurance of claude to get stuck based on previous and potentially failed attemps that it keeps in its short term memory, such that it can no longer solve problems correctly.

As the `human-in-the-loop` its your job to guard the context as much as possible.

This means pasting error messages, screenshots (yes you can paste images into Claude Code CLI) anything that would help you to solve the problem.

Once the code has converged on something that works, and the tests pass, you should carefully commit the work. Claude can and will look at old git history so think of this as your long term memory which you don't want to pollute with context rot either.

The way I do this currently, is by having:
- one terminal for claude (running over `vt` vibetunnel in case I step away from the computer)
- one terminal for my own operations
- `src` an alias for `open -a "Sourcetree" .`

And then what I do is keep an eye on the changes that Claude makes and stage them as I think they are worth keeping and reset them or delete them if I think they are going off the rails.

I am both steering the short term context and also preventing the git history from filling up with crap.
I rarely let Claude commit as it has no taste when it comes to clean commits and often just adds everything; and I find its git commit messages to be too long, so I ask it to write terse ones and edit them myself.

<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/workflow.jpg" style="width: 100%;" alt="workflow-diagram">

```Yes I use sourcetree from Atlassian... anyone know a better free visual diff tool?... ü§î "HEY CLAAAUDEE"?```

In the new world of infinite monkeys on typewriters we need to search for the shakespearian gems and discard the rest.

### Short and Sweet
Sometimes claude code is super verbose in a bad way, karpathy talks about this in his talk <a href="https://youtu.be/LCEmiRjPEtQ">Software Is Changing (Again)</a>; and urges us to keep AI on a short leash.

Rather than have a 500 line tests.sh script that takes a bunch of flags I dont care about and does weird edge case handling, its much better to have something you can read easily.
```
#!/bin/bash
set -e
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
uv pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest tests
```


### Charlie Work
<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/cmux-ci.png" style="width: 50%; float: right;" alt="cmux-ci-image"> You know what is a great way to waste an entire day or week? Fixing random bugs in different OSes on GitHub CI. 

Not anymore.

Because Claude has your authed `gh` tool it can `commit`, `push`, `check ci logs`, rinse and repeat.

Claude did all the work to get `crabmux` tested and released while I was writing this blog post üëâ

<div style="clear: both;"></div>


<h3 id="concurrency-amdahls-law">Concurrency</h3>

Since the invention of computers with more than 1 cpu, we have struggled as a  (code lumberjacks) to truly nail the ability to squeeze maximum performance out of multi-core computers.<br />  

The simplest way to use more than 1 CPU core is to do more than 1 thing at once.

While `claude` might go brrr... on a task faster than you could have yourself, due to the `start-stop-start-stop` nature of Agentic Engineering, you will find yourself idling... and reading too much `x.com` (halp!).

The real `x100 engineer` productivity doesn't just come from using an AI agent to do 1 thing, it comes from multiplexing across multiple things.

Great programmers know that the `real magic` happening in your brain, is the mental focus juggling the relationship between all the objects, files and data flows.

<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/mentat.jpg" style="width: 50%;" alt="mentat-image">

```what the flow-state looks like from the outside```

I believe that same ability to `multi-plex` between things efficiently is where the true unlock can occur with `agentic engineering`.


### Git Worktrees
This is basically the same as `git clone`-ing multiple times into different folders EXCEPT that they share the same `.git` database and therefore you can merge and checkout between those folders without having to push and pull.

What I do:

```
syftbox
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main <- clone this first
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workspace1 <- create these as neede
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workspace2
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workspace3
```

All you do is:
```
mkdir syftbox
git clone git@github.com:OpenMined/syftbox.git syftbox/main
cd syftbox/main

# then make a worktree
git worktree add -b some-branch ../workspace1

# then launch from that directory
cd ../workspace1
vt claude
```

Of course you can just clone lots of folders or ask Claude to do this for you, but be careful, you don't want 2 agents working on the same code.

### Amdahl's Law
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law" target="_blank">
    <img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/amdahls-law.png" style="width: 50%;" alt="amdahls-law-image">
</a>

```Amdahl's Law illustrates the potential speedup of a task using multiple processors.```

If you study the graph you'll note that if you have sufficient concurrency you can achieve 3-4x speed up with 4x different things going on; as long as you keep the parallel portion to `>90%`.

I'm not suprised to hear Peter in his interview above say he also works on about `3-4` things at once in parallel. I think that might be a sort of `magic number` based on the 90% concurrency levels and the depth and distance that agents can go without `context rot` settting in.

<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/concurrent.jpg" style="width: 100%;" alt="concurrent-image">

```on claude fueled tokamine, I currently do about 3-4 things at once```

Additionally, due to the `slot machine` (as peter calls them) randomness of success, that means sometimes you need another thread going on, just to get lucky with a potential `1 shot` win. As Armin said when I spoke to him: `"Sometimes it 1 shots a whole week of work"`. To maximize the value of `1 week-1 shots` you need to have at least 1 high reward side-bet thread going on.


<h3 id="speed-apm-context-engineering">Speed, APM & Context Engineering</h3>

You can speed Claude up a lot by giving it custom tools that use less tokens and are more precise.  
<br />
Armin also talks about checkpoints in his video, which work as kind of sentinel strings in code execution output (`caveman debugging for claude`) that help claude to reason about the execution flow of the program its creating across contexts (think browser, client, server etc).

The quicker you can get Claude to focus on the right problem the quicker it will solve it.

The other way to `maximize` your effectiveness is to move quickly.

You might think: now that the agent does all the typing I can go slowly, right? 

But the opposite is true, you are the bottleneck.

If you aren't already deeply familiar with your Operating System / Application keyboard shortcuts, its time to learn them and increase your `APM`.

#### APM
What is APM (Actions Per Minute)?
There is a game called `StarCraft` which at its peak was the most valuable and respected eSport. Its a real time strategy game where the sheer ability for a human player to control thousands of units and dozens of buildings is often the bottleneck to winning.

People figured out that if you recorded how many Actions a player was taking per minute you could estimate their ability to win. There have been <a href="https://www.academia.edu/51743825/A_Quick_Look_at_StarCraft_Brood_War_Professional_Players" target="_blank">papers published about it</a>.

<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/starcraft.jpg" style="width: 50%; float: right;" alt="starcraft-image">

The findings indicated that `higher APM and eAPM` are associated with increased `win rates`, suggesting that both speed and efficiency in actions contribute to success.

Theres a possibility that in the future, the best Agentic Engineers might also cross-over with the best eSports players.

<h3 id="keyboard-shortcuts-workflow-tricks">Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>
Since you want to be able to switch around as fast as possible and act as a context conduit for your claude army make sure you can do the following.

`These are MacOS options, you can ask your LLM for the ones for your OS.`

- snap windows to grid (cmd + option + {letter}, with <a href="https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/" target="_blank">magnet</a>)
- split terminal pane (cmd + shift + d)
- close window (usually cmd + q)
- close tab (usually cmd + w)
- new tab (usually cmd + t)
- navigate tabs (usually cmd + option ‚Üê or cmd + option ‚Üí)
- navigate words (usally option + ‚Üê or option + ‚Üí)

CLI commands:
- `wd {name}` warp to any directory with <a href="https://github.com/dremio/warpdrive">warpdrive</a>
- `src` (my personal alias for `open -a "Sourcetree" .`)
- `cursor .` (open cursor here)
- `vt claude` (start claude in a vibetunnel)
- `gh / git xyz` (do careful git commands without claude by hand)
- `open .` (open a finder explorer window to do drag and drop)


#### What Tools do I use?
- ChatGPT
    - general questions
    - creating logos and page design images
- Claude chat
    - creating some html/css designs sometimes
- Claude Code + Max
- Cursor
    - for precision `AI-hand edits` (lol)
- Gemini
    - for large text like video subtitles or pdfs
- Little Snitch Firewall
    - this is even more valuable now that I have an agent doing random things, if it tries to reach out to a domain that I didn't allow, little snitch will ask me and it can block or prevent it
    - but don't buzz kill the vibes too much
- Pixelmator for quick image edits
- Twitter / X
    - Things move so fast this has replaced HN for me (thanks @steipete)
- HackerNews
    - Less so because theres no algo to help me (oh claaauuude)

Its pretty clear its the early wild west days, and the exciting thing is anyone including YOU can cook up something cool and publish it with an Agent in the background, all while you do your normal job... or just hangout in the pool on `vibetunnel.sh`. üòé

<h2 id="orgs-teams-the-future">Orgs, Teams & The Future</h2>

<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/orgs.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="orgs-image">

<br />
<h3 id="orgs-and-">First on Orgs</h3>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEQjwE7hDjk&ab_channel=Sana" target="_blank"><img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/ethan-mollick.png" width="400px" alt="Ethan Mollick" style="float: right;"></a>

In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEQjwE7hDjk&ab_channel=Sana" target="_blank">recent interview</a> on the Strange Loop Podcast, titled: Every leader needs this AI strategy, Wharton professor and leading AI researcher <a href="https://x.com/emollick">Ethan Mollick (@emollick)</a> gave some really excellent advice based on lots of real world interviews and research of companies big and small.

He says that: In a study at Procter and Gamble: `"individuals working alone with AI performed as well as teams"`.

I think when you understand the latency between your brain, your high `APM` finger stokes and your 4 x Claude Slot Machines versus the old way of `"hopping on a call"`, you can see why.


He goes on to say that teams: `"that work with AI were much more likely to come up with really breakthrough ideas."`

Something that people like Peter keep talking about is how much better results are when you ask Claude and other AI agents to give you a plan with options. Its as though the `latent space` between competing constraints in the very words used to describe said options maps directly to `real world juxtaposed optimal solutions`.

He goes on to say that due to the efficiency gains from AI there are really two paths forward for most organizations.

Either Path A:  
`increase efficiency and make more money per barrel of ale`

or Path B: `expand reach and be Guinness and hire 100,000 people and expand worldwide`

He points out that the first org chart was created in 1855 for the New York and Erie Railroad as a solution to a problem of coordinating physical assets (trains) with a new technology (the telegraph).

Then speaks about the implications of using such an outdated model in the AI first world and goes on to lament that organizational innovation is a lost art: 

`"modern western companies have given up on organizational innovation as something that they do".`

Even breakthroughs like Henry Ford's production lines and early 2000s agile development:

`"broke because they all depended on there being only one form of intelligence available which is human"`. 

Ethan points out that in a world where intelligence comes in `"humansized packages"` you must organize around the `"span of control of five or seven people"`.

None of the above is true anymore.
Everything has changed.

<h3 id="leadership-labs-hiring">The Leadership, Crowd, Lab Model</h3>

In the interview Ethan suggests existing organizations adopt a three step model he calls: Leadership, Crowd, Lab.
<br />
- Leadership sets the safety / direction  <br />

Ethan talks about the natural conflict between someone discovering they can automate their job and whether they should tell their manager.

To solve this you must adopt an attitude of:  `"We won't fire people for this. We'll grow bigger."`

He goes on to ask:
`"how do you create the incentive so they share what they're doing, right?"`

And, from the employee's perspective: 
`"why would I ever want to share my productivity benefits with the organization without being compensated".`

He says one company gave out `$10,000` cash prizes at the end of every week to whoever did the best job automating their job.

- Crowd means let everyone explore AI tools

Ethan says estimates are only 1-2% of employees are AI naturals.

`And then you'll find like one or two percent of your organization is just brilliant at this stuff. They're amazing at it. Those are the people who will be able to lead you in your AI development effort.`

- Build Labs means rethinking KPIs

Ethan suggests orgs build labs to scale discoveries by putting your best AI capable talent to work building tools and workflows to supersize everyone else.

Identify your internal high agency people:

`"those become the people that become the center of your lab and figure out how to use it."`

Ethan points out since no one knows what to do next:
`"in the early R&D phase, the worst thing you do is have a bunch of KPIs, right. I really worry about KPIs, measurable KPIs being doom".`

He emphasizes the key to operating a lab type environment is the freedom to  explore.  

### Maximalism

Another thing Ethan talks about is not holding back.
```
Be Maximalist, not Incremental. I think that the thing to aim is to be maximalist. I think too few organizations are maximalist. Just push the system to do everything.
```

An example of being maximalist he gives is:

```
Every ideation session you stop in the middle of meetings and you ask AI how's it going so far or whether or not you should continue the meeting at all.
```

On Hiring, Ethan advises:

```
Before you hired anyone, you needed to show um you need to spend two hours as a team trying to do the job with AI and then rewrite the job description around the fact that AI would be used.
```

#### Choose a Path

Are you going down path A:  
`"fewer people um doing more impressive work"`

Or are you going down path B:  
`"more people doing ever more work and trying to take over the world together"`

You can build tools and techniques that are really useful, but ultimately it has to be people in the company who figure out if something is good or bad. 

They're the ones with the experience and evidence to do it. If they're terrified of making those judgments‚Äîbecause they might get fired, punished for using AI, or replaced if there's an efficiency gain‚Äîthey'll never show you an efficiency gain.

#### Hire Experts  
Ethan points out that AI actually makes Senior Talent disproportionally better than juniors. The problem with juniors is the faithfully copy and paste what the AI says. Its the experts who can rapidly take the 80% correct and then fix the 20% wrong and know untuiatively when to integrate the novel and exceptional ideas that AI surfaces.

Human Expertise is More Valuable, Not Less: 
```
It turns out expertise actually is really good. None of these systems are as good as an actual expert at the top of their fields.
```


<h2>4 Examples</h2>
Over the last few months, I happen to have listened and read about a variety of different orgs and how they are operating. 

Lets take a look at what 4 different orgs are doing right now and how that lines up with advice from Ethan above.

### Answer Dot AI - An R&D First Org

<a href="https://youtu.be/MbHL0uvKYbE" target="_blank"><img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/jeremy.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="concurrent-image"></a>

I find Ethans comments really interesting because I watched a <a href="https://youtu.be/MbHL0uvKYbE" target="_blank">great podcast</a> a few weeks ago by the illustrious <a href="https://x.com/jeremyphoward" target="_blank">Jeremy Howard (@jeremyphoward)</a> and <a href="https://x.com/mattturck" target="_blank">Matt Turck (@mattturck)</a> and noticed he said a lot of similar things about his org <a href="https://www.answer.ai/" target="_blank">Answer.AI</a>.

It would seem that Jeremy is all about Path A, small team efficiency and he doesn't just have a makeshift `internal lab`, Answer.AI IS an `R&D lab`.

In the interview Jeremy talks about how they have built internal tools for `"dialogue engineering"` that multiplies the efficiency of their own teams such that they don't need to grow.

In fact in Jeremy's own words: `"growth is a failure case"` because limiting team size forces them to be extremely efficient. So much so they do not have professional managers or traditional roles.

Much like Ethan Mollick is urging leaders to innovate in their org structure, Jeremy has taken a leaf out of `Thomas Edison's` book and his infamous lab in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison">`Menlo Park`</a>.

Menlo Park had a team of "tinkerers" who experimented with new technology (electricity) to see what could be made.

In this environment the invention of light bulbs, dynamos, phonographs and early motion pictures were created. This wasn't just Science this was Art!

Jeremy explains how Answer.AI acts in in similar `R & D` style. They operate on a tight cycle where development drives research.

As they try to build a product, if they hit a constraint, they perform the necessary research to overcome it; which in turn opens up new green fields, which in turn leads to new potential products.

Instead of scaling by hiring more people and creating departments, Answer.AI are building a `"substrate"` of AI, automation, and internal tools. This substrate, which includes their development platform `"Solve it"` and web framework `"fasthtml"` is what allows them to get faster and give themselves `"superpowers"`.

To Ethans point above about `KPIs`, what KPIs would Thomas Eddison have given his R&D Staff? And would they have created the same staggering 400 patents had they been given targets to reach? I'd love to hear Jeremy's answer to that one.

Most relevant to this post, Jeremy talks about how Answer.AI has a secret weapon internal tool called `Solve it` (jeremy i'd love an invite to try it) which he says blends the best worlds of:
- cursor
- jupyter
- claude code
- chatgpt

‚òùÔ∏è Can you imagine that? üôä

Until I used Claude Code with Tokamine Mode I didn't really appreciate how powerful this kind of tool will actually be, but now I fully get it, and I still jump to Jupyter often and find its lack of AI tooling kills my flow.

Answer.AI's core belief is that the optimal approach to AI Productivity software is a close, interactive collaboration between humans and AI.  

Jeremy is also acutely aware of the critical importance pointed out by Karpathy in his Software 3.0 video of creating tooling and outputs for LLMs (People Spirits) and had already created <a href="http://llmstxt.org/" target="_blank">llms.txt</a> way back in September 2024.

In this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvayXoxzVQw&ab_channel=PeterYang">excellent interview</a> with the supercool <a href="https://x.com/sjgreggwallace">Sam Gregg-Wallace (@sjgreggwallace)</a> the head of Talent at Shopify and the epic <a href="https://x.com/petergyang">Peter Yang (@petergyang)</a> they discuss how Shopify is `maximally` doubling down on engineering efficiency by innovating in org structure and roles.

Shopify has dismantled the traditional corporate ladder to create a `"mastery system"` that elevates the role of individual contributors to be as or more important than managers. 

Sam explains how the company focuses on hiring and retaining `"the best crafters in the world"` who are passionate about the quality of the product.

He says the company culture encourages a `"low distraction"` environment where crafters can `"cook"`. This means removing internal obstacles, such as `excessive meetings` and `document writing`, so that individuals can focus on prototyping and `shipping code`.

A key aspect of this philosophy is to hire `"high agency people"` who `"give a sh*t"` about their work and the `company's mission`. 

Sam says: 
```
Let crafters cook, right? What what what is the biggest slowdown is seeking internal alignment or writing docs instead of just just doing the work prototyping and shipping code.
```

I saw a tweet from <a href="https://x.com/ArthurMacwaters">Arthur MacWaters (@arthurmacwaters)</a> the Founder of Legion Health which says what Sam is talking about.

<div style="transform: scale(0.6); transform-origin: top left; height:400px;">

</div>

The sub-text is clear. People want self managing employees, people with high agency. Dogs that walk themselves, not people who need to be managed.

An article from May on `Business Insider` (paywalled) titled: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-amazon-google-embrace-flatter-structure-fewer-managers-boost-efficiency-2025-5">Big Tech is crushing middle managers. Some fear the great flattening has gone too far,</a> says:

```
Amazon has also increased the ratio of individual contributors to managers. It calls it a "builder ratio." Google CEO Sundar Pichai told staff late last year that the company cut vice president and manager roles by 10% as part of an efficiency push. Meta has been at it for years, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg writing in a 2023 memo, "Flatter is faster."
```

If Ethan is right, perhaps the org structures that gave rise to "Corporate Management" might be no longer fit for purpose in this AI enabled future.

#### What is High Agency?
If you haven't already, I highly recommend reading <a href="https://x.com/george__mack">George Macks (@george__mack)</a> amazing blog on High Agency.

If there is one thing that will bifurcate workers with Agentic Engineering and AI tools its having high agency.

### Cursor maintains Hacker Energy

<a href="https://youtu.be/oOylEw3tPQ8"><img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/cursor-interview.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="cursor-interview-image"></a>

In this <a href="https://youtu.be/oOylEw3tPQ8">interview</a> Going Beyond Code, Superintelligent AI Agents, And Why Taste Still Matters with Ycombinator host <a href="https://x.com/garrytan">Garry Tan (@garrytan)</a> and <a href="https://x.com/mntruell/">Michael Truell (@mntruell)</a> they discuss how Cursor started and how they have structured their organization for maximum effectiveness.

Michael talks a lot about what Cursor (company Anysphere), potentially the first AI unicorn since the new AI tooling wave (they kind of started) does for hiring and managing staff.

Firstly, he points out the co-founders, including the CEO, are all technical and continue to `write code` to maintain Anysphere's founding "hacker energy" even as it scales.

The culture is built on a foundation of intense product focus, experimentation, he says, and blends both coordinated and independent work.

While there are `"big projects that require a lot of coordination amongst people where you need top down alignment,"` they are also committed to being a place that fosters `"a good degree of bottoms up experimentation too"`.

Michael says to encourage this bottom-up innovation, they have a specific structural approach where they:
```
explicitly take teams of engineers, sectioning them off from the rest of the company and kind of just giving them carte blanche to to experiment on what they'd like.
```

This echos much of what Ethan, Jeremy and Sam have said above.

A core part of their product development process is a relentless focus on dogfooding their own tool, `"the kind of main thing that we really acted on was just we reload the editor"`.

Throughout the interview Michael emphasizes the importance of hiring the right people and maintaining a that `"hacker energy"` through experimentation and a focus on passionate individuals.

On hiring he cautions to: `"really nail the first 10 people to come into the company they will both accelerate you in the future"`

He says these initial employees act as `"keepers of holding the bar really high"`, the opposite of which is often called "Bozo Effect".

Michale says they seek out `"generalist polymaths"` who are fantastic at building and shipping production code quickly. 

The ideal candidate is someone who can `"bleed across disciplines,"` being "product minded, commercially minded but had actually trained models at scale".




### The Bozo Effect
Popularized by <a href="https://x.com/guykawasaki">Guy Kawasaki (@guykawasaki)</a>
and explained in this <a href="https://www.vollardian.com/blog/ewoius9t0o1mrbro4s7n42wxdym6ga?utm_source=chatgpt.com">blog post</a> by `Arani Satgunaseelan` from `Vollardian`:
```
Steve believed that A players hire A players‚Äîthat is people who are as good as they are. I refined this slightly‚Äîmy theory is that A players hire people even better than themselves. It‚Äôs clear, though, that B players hire C players so they can feel superior to them, and C players hire D players. If you start hiring B players, expect what Steve called 'the bozo explosion' to happen in your organization.
```




### Google is So Back
<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/gemini.png" style="width: 100%" alt="gemini-image">
You might be forgiven for thinking this kind of organizatioal innovation is only for new smaller orgs, but thats not true.

As of this writing, Google has also dropped their own CLI tool `gemini-cli`.

One of the largest culture shifts in history seems to have been taking place internally at Google under Sundar Pichai and Sir Demis Hassabis.

I have been following the awesome Google Principal Engineer <a href="https://x.com/rakyll">Jaana Dogan (@rakyll)</a> for a while on Twitter and recently she seems to be talking alot about how Google has internally rebooted into a totally different org.

I have to say between things like Notebook LM and Gemini 2.5 Pro, Open Source Gemma models and now `gemini-cli`, it does very much feel like `"We're so back"!`

So what has Jaana been saying that mirrors Ethan and the 3 above?

Just see some of these banger tweets from Rakyll:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The overall velocity of software has visibly changed in the last two years. I don&#39;t think our existing ways to structure companies work anymore.

‚òùÔ∏è And that was in February!!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">People last year: Google has completely missed the AI race, no way to flip things around.<br><br>People this year: Google has some of the strongest assets in AI.

With this new attitude I might just be ready to re-consider a Pixel phone again.

If Google can do this, then anyone can.




## My Thoughts
### How to Organize
Okay, so how should you organize in light of this new change. To Ethans point, organizational structures are trapped in the 1800's and `"modern western companies have given up on organizational innovation as something that they do"`.

It takes bold brave winners like Answer.AI, Shopify, Cursor and even Google to try new things and not be afraid to throw out some bathwater out.


### Teams / Collaboration

I spoke with several people including `Armin` and it seems at this stage no one knows how best to collaborate with these tools.

He told me about a tool that Mario Zechner <a href="https://x.com/badlogicgames" target="_blank">@badlogicgames</a> was cooking up which lets you share your Claude session context a bit like ChatGPT. You can check it out <a href="https://mariozechner.at/uploads/yakety-claude.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

But in discussing it, the question we both pondered was: 

```
Is it faster to read through some extremely long brain fart context someone else created with their Coding Genie or just summon your own instantly for free?
```

The CEO of `Amp` <a href="https://x.com/sqs" target="_blank">@sqs Quinn Slack</a>

Was posting on x about a cool feature they have in AMP</a> (an alternative to claude code), for <a href="https://x.com/sqs/status/1939033780326670693">Team thread sharing</a>. I haven't tried it yet, but I intend to.

I no doubt that the next `JIRA` is going to be a totally new tool that blends Agentic Engineering and collaboration.

In the meantime though its not clear exactly how individuals `multi-plexing` across 3-4 things in parallel collaborate, except to break up work and projects in a modular / ecosystem fashion so people don't step on each others toes.

The responsibility in making your code understandable by someone elses Agent is now partially on you, and partially on them. Tests, docs and good architecture (even if Agent made) still trump here.


### Hiring and Roles

<a href="https://youtu.be/AUUZuzVHKdo"><img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/satya-interview.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="Satya Nadella"></a>

You can't hire what you can't name, and there has been a huge shift in traditional titles and the emergence of many new fusion roles.

In a recent interview <a href="https://x.com/satyanadella">Satya Nadella (@satyanadella)</a> the CEO of Microsoft said:
```
At LinkedIn I think they took multiple of these functions, the design function the front-end engineer function the product function put them all together and said we're going to have full stack builders.

That's a change in scope of even a job and so how do you then rebuild the product team with new roles new scopes and what have you.
```

Sataya then goes on to talk about the rise of the FDE.
```
A lot of the AI startups I talk to, everyone has worked at Palantir so, everyone has forward deployment engineers.
```

### Rise of the Builders and FDE's
In another recent <a href="https://youtu.be/DL82mGde6wo">ycombinator podcast</a> from may (called In the Lightcone) with the same excellent host <a href="https://x.com/garrytan">Garry Tan (@garrytan)</a>, they talk about how Palantir inveted the `Forward Deployed Engineer` and why so many of their new technical founders are ex-FDE's.

Firstly its worth noting that, <a href="https://x.com/barrald">Barry (@barrald)</a> an ex-FDE has written a blog post talking about <a href="https://www.barry.ooo/posts/fde-culture">why you shouldn't use FDEs in your organization</a>.

However, I think its worth looking at what the emergence of these blended roles like: `full stack builder` and `forward deployed engineer` really means.

The goal of a fusion is to take the best qualities of two or more things and produce a new thing.

It is well known that some of the best films are made by individuals who are both `writer` and `director`. Talent like Alex Garland, James Cameron, Christopher Nolan, Taika Waititi and Quentin Tarantino create nothing but gold.

As AI helps us to be more effective doing a specific job, it allows us to rise up the stack and take on more scope.

#### So what is an FDE?

- Is an Engineer first
- Makes a good Technical Founder
- Works closely with customers
- Builds custom solutions
- Rapid prototyping 
- Gather product feedback
- Product Minded
- Results Orientated

According to the podcast above, ex-Palantir FDEs are now some of the top Y Comb founders because they combine the magic of engineering skills and a high bias for action.

The rapid evolution of AI and LLMs makes this model more potent than ever. Founders can have initial meetings with enterprise clients, understand their specific needs, and then quickly `"stuff"` that context into a prompt to create a highly effective, customized demo.

In the podcast they talk about real world examples where a traditional sales team would spend 12 weeks wooing a customer with steakhouses hoping to sign a deal.

Meanwhile the FDE approach meant flying an engineer to literally `"sit next to the FBI Agent"` the domain expert and turn around a working prototype in days.

#### Whats a Full Stack Builder?
The term `fullstack` has been around for a while since the `fusion` of front-end and backend skills or mobile and server has yielded better faster and more cohesive output.

The same way that `devops` surpassed `sysdamin / sysops` as a fusion role.

Builder has become a new term for a very `hacker` ethos style engineer that is scrapy, hands on and results oriented.

Put that all together and a `full stack builder` is basically someone who can work with any platform or technology, has a high bias toward action and cares about the outcome of the thing being made.

I'd say this is pretty similar to the FDE except there is no emphasis on the client consulting side of things. Builders feel more like your lumberjacks or R&D lab engineers.

FDEs are more like 1 man band, lead singer, solo song writers.

#### What about AI Automation Engineer?

Given how powerful AI is for automation, it seems people are starting to look for specialized talent that can `meta-engineer` the engineering role by using AI to automate `all the things`.

CEO of Quora <a href="https://x.com/adamdangelo">Adam D'Angelo (@adamdangelo)</a> posted a job ad on X.


Heres a <a href="https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/quora/b0ef4655-20b0-4c4f-93d2-037556c6c9e5">job ad from Quora</a> seeking an AI Automation Engineer.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are opening up a new role at Quora: a single engineer who will use AI to automate manual work across the company and increase employee productivity. I will work closely with this person. <a href="https://t.co/iKurWS6W7v">pic.twitter.com/iKurWS6W7v</a></p>&mdash; Adam D&#39;Angelo (@adamdangelo) <a href="https://twitter.com/adamdangelo/status/1936504553916309617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 21, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

It seems that people are picking up on this high agency, AI first automation engineering culture.


However to Ethans point above, since no one knows yet how to hire native AI talent this poses some interesting challenges.

If you listen to Cursor's CEO, they still focus very heavily on traditional engineering talent when hiring for their company. Most playbooks will say just hire smart people regadless, because smart people are smart no matter what their occupation.

One thing is for sure, you probably want high agency self-walking dogs who aren't afraid of leaping `maximally` into Agentic Engineering workflows.

## Advice for Orgs / Managers

- decide if you are going path A: `more efficient`
- or path B: `bigger`
- tell everyone they will be rewarded for sharing AI efficiency
- roll out AI tools to everyone
    - I suggest an open monthly budget
    - tools change far too often for yearly subs
- buy your staff more time with faster
    - computers
    - internet connections
    - less interruptions
- ~$200-500 USD is probably about right
    - that's nothing if you consider they could be at least 2x+ing their productivity
- reconsider traditional job roles
    - lean into smart high agency people
    - hire domain experts who can close the gap on AI
- flatten structures
- make teams smaller and more autonomous 
- only write job decriptions for things AI can't do in 2 hours
- hire for hybrid / blended roles
    - Forward Deployed Engineer
    - Full Stack Builder
    - AI Automation Engineer
- send your customers FDEs rather than sales people
- get your whole orgs context into a LLM friendly formats and services


### Advice for Engineers
You are likely to have new team members moving forward who are not human People Spirits who you manage and build context for.

As Karpathy says in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ&ab_channel=YCombinator">Software 3.0 video</a> LLMs are "stochastic simulations of people" or "people spirits". This explains their human-like yet imperfect and "jagged" intelligence.

Andrei says people spirits dont have the reliable execution to be trusted, build oursoftware for human in the loop, so its important to:

- create short feedback loops
- protect against `context rot`
- put AI agents on a short leash
- don't generate so much spam you can't review it

Keep that in mind when building software from now on:
- can your system work via curl
- is it easy to copy and paste text from output
- is it open source so the LLMs learn about it automatically
- are you using things like <a href="https://x.com/jeremyphoward" target="_blank">Jeremy Howard (@jeremyphoward)</a>'s: <a href="https://llmstxt.org/">https://llmstxt.org/</a>

Also don't be dismayed, as Karpathy says this is an "insane" time to be entering the software industry, with a vast amount of work to be done in rewriting existing software and building new, partially autonomous products. 


### Advice for Startups / Business Models
The industry is awash again in crazy valuations and rounds for things people don't get like `Cluey`, raising 15 million from `a16z`.

Somneone on twitter recently pointed out that `Cluey` is just Software 3.0 prompts in a desktop app:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I reverse engineered <a href="https://twitter.com/cluely?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@cluely</a> ‚Äì and their desktop source code exposes their entire system prompts and models used.<br><br>What&#39;s inside? üßµ <a href="https://t.co/y5BcxFjbvB">pic.twitter.com/y5BcxFjbvB</a></p>&mdash; Jack Cable (@jackhcable) <a href="https://twitter.com/jackhcable/status/1936500980297932827?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 21, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


You'd think its gold rush time. And it might be.

I do think we should pay heed to the bitter lesson though.

#### The Bitter Lesson

Theres an excellent blog series that came out this year from <a href="https://x.com/lukaspet">Lukas Petersson (@lukaspet)</a> in which he compares the famous <a href="http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html">`Bitter Lesson` from Rich Sutton</a> to whats happening in the world of AI startups.

<a href="https://lukaspetersson.com/blog/2025/bitter-vertical/">AI Founder's Bitter Lesson. Chapter 1 - History Repeats Itself</a>.

It's worth the read but one thing caught my eye. In chapter 2 he talks about `Helmer‚Äôs 7 powers` a framework for thinking about what protective moats a business has.

AI verticals will struggle to find a moat in other ways too. No advantage in any of Helmer‚Äôs 7 Powers.
<a href="https://lukaspetersson.com/blog/2025/power-vertical/" target="_blank"><img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/comp_hard.png" style="width: 50%; float: right;" alt="comp_hard"></a>

Except one special area of interest the: `Cornered Resource`.

Special access to valuable assets under favorable conditions that create competitive advantage. This could include exclusive rights, patents, or `data`.

Lukas predicts that the only business models safe from AGI systems are ones which have a truly exclusive resource such as a dataset that could only be gathered during a rare event.

While we might be a way off before that happens, its critical to think about the near future as time-line predictions keep getting revised down.

### Agents set us free

Finally, its worth stopping to marvel at what we have collectively built with our ingnenuity and data.

What does the Agentic revolution mean for you?

The builder community on X the likes of the amazing <a href="https://x.com/levelsio" target="_blank">@levelsio</a> are continually pushing the boundaries of what it means to work. How long before we are all finally untethered from our laptops?

-------------------------------------
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>

***Everything has changed.***

Do you remember when the inspiring <a href="https://x.com/waitbutwhy">Tim Urban (@waitbutwhy)</a> made this post over (checks notes) 10 years ago:
The AI Revolution: The Road to Superintelligence
<a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html"><img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/edge.png" style="" alt="the wall"></a>


Well this is where we are now:

<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/running.png" alt="running">


This is probably a moment more significant that `chatgpt` itself. Unlike AI assisting humans, humans assisting AI flips the model and promises to tap into Amdahl's Law and truly multiply every humans efforts. 

<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/goats.jpg" style="width: 50%; float: right;" alt="GOAT">

There is no longer a MOAT. Everyone can be a G.O.A.T.

If you have always wanted to create software or nearly anything (lets face it what isn't driven by software now?), now is the time, don't hold back, dive right in.

But Madhava you say: surely I, a non technical person can't learn to cut trees with a chainsaw.

Actually you are wrong. This is exactly what Jeremy Howard did with Fast.AI. He taught an entire generation of domain experts and coders how to use AI and do amazing things (thanks Jeremy ‚ù§Ô∏è).

In the end, it turns out smart people are smart no matter what their occupation.

The berlin wall of occupational gatekeeping has just started to crack.

### For Orgs
Existing companies need to adapt, and fast. New companies will forge new innovative paths and models of organizing, collaborating and easily outcompete them.

As a company if you reap more efficiency gains, don't forget to share the value back with your employees. That can be through money and it can be through stress and pressure, time to breath and live.

<a href="https://gizmodo.com/openai-reportedly-shuts-down-for-a-week-as-zuck-poaches-its-top-talent-2000622145">Even OpenAI is tired and needs a break.</a>

Deploy AI `maximally` and find those naturals in your existing staff. Follow the lead of companies like Cursor, Shoppify, Answer.AI and now even Google (they're so back), and put your company culture on "low distraction" mode so crafters can "cook".

Every internal obstacle (excessive meetings and document writing) you remove is another multiplier to their productivity prototyping and shipping code.

<img src="/images/agentic-coding-slot-machines/greenfields.png" style="width: 50%; float: right;" alt="genie">
Listening to all the resources mentioned in this post, and speaking to people about this, it seems no one really knows where this is going; But it‚Äôs green fields in all directions and the blue sky is the limit.
